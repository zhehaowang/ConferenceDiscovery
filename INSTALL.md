NdnRtc-Addon:  Chat and Conference Discovery Addon for NdnRtc
==============================================================

Prerequisites
=============

* Required: ndn-cpp built with boost shared pointers.
* Required: libprotobuf
* Required: libcrypto
* Tested with OSX 10.9.5 and OSX 10.10

Build
=====
To build in a terminal, change directory to the NdnRtc-Addon root.  Enter:

    ./configure
    make .proto
    make

Files
=====
This makes the following libraries:

* libs/libchrono-chat2013.la
* libs/libconference-discovery.la

This makes the following test files:

* bin/test-both
* bin/test-chat

Development
===========
Follow Development Prerequisites above for your platform.
Now you can add source code files and update Makefile.am.
After updating, change directory to the NDN-CPP root and enter the following to build the Makefile:

    ./autogen.sh

To build again, follow the instructions above (./configure, make, etc.)

Working with ndn-cpp-0.7 and NDNRTC
===========
To use this with ndnrtc, may want to use this configure command (as NDNRTC is compiled with libstdc++):
<pre>
./configure NDNCPPDIR=<include path of ndn-cpp compiled with libstdc++> NDNCPPLIB=<lib path of ndn-cpp compiled with libstdc++> PROTOBUFDIR=<include path of protobuf compiled with libstdc++> PROTOBUFLIB=<lib path of ndn-cpp compiled with libstdc++> CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libstdc++"
</pre>
Per onInterest deprecation in ndn-cpp-0.7, onInterest function signatures were changed to onInterestCallback

If symbol not found appeared during linking stage, the most likely cause is that some of the dependencies are compiled with libstdc++, while others with libc++; the ones with libstdc++ usually have __1 in their function signature.
